# moonshot_project
Moonshot 2024 project, activity list.
This is a project to help log
and list activities you have 
done during the day. It asks 
for your name, the time, and 
the activity.

_Quick note_: To use this, you 
first have to change the lists 
from loading pickled files to 
regular lists, load them once, 
make an item in the list, and 
then change it back. Otherwise 
it won't have a file to go to.
